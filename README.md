- [Simple Moving Average (SMA)](#simple-moving-average-sma)
- [Moving Standard Deviation (Std)](#moving-standard-deviation-std)
- [Exponential Moving Average (EMA)](#exponential-moving-average-ema)
- [Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)](#moving-average-convergence-divergence-macd)
- [Bollinger Bands](#bollinger-bands)
- [Bollinger Band Width](#bollinger-band-width)
- [Awesome Oscillator](#awesome-oscillator)
- [Williams R](#williams-r)
- [Typical Price](#typical-price)
- [Relative Strength Index (RSI)](#relative-strength-index-rsi)

## Usage

Install package.

```bash
go get github.com/cinar/indicator
```

Import indicator.

```Golang
import (
    "indicator"
)
```

### Moving Averages

#### Simple Moving Average (SMA)

The [Sma](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#Sma) function calculates the simple moving average for a given period.

```Golang
result := indicator.Sma(2, []float64{2, 4, 6, 8, 10})
```

#### Moving Standard Deviation (Std)

The [Std](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#Std) function calculates the moving standard deviation for a given period.

```Golang
result := indicator.Std(2, []float64{2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20})
```

#### Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

The [Ema](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#Ema) function calculates the exponential moving average for a given period.

```Golang
result := indicator.Ema(2, []float64{2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20})
```

### Indicators

#### Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

The [Macd](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#Macd) function calculates a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of price.

```
MACD = 12-Period EMA - 26-Period EMA.
Signal = 9-Period EMA of MACD.
```

```Golang
macd, signal := indicator.Macd(close)
```

#### Bollinger Bands

The [BollingerBands](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#BollingerBands) function calculates the bollinger bands, middle band, upper band, lower band, provides identification of when a stock is oversold or overbought.

```
Middle Band = 20-Period SMA.
Upper Band = 20-Period SMA + 2 (20-Period Std)
Lower Band = 20-Period SMA - 2 (20-Period Std)
```

```Golang
middleBand, upperBand, lowerBand := indicator.BollingerBands(close)
```

#### Bollinger Band Width

The [BollingerBandWidth](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#BollingerBandWidth) function 
measures the percentage difference between the upper band and the lower band. It decreases as
Bollinger Bands narrows and increases as Bollinger Bands widens.

During a period of rising price volatility the band width widens, and during a period of low market
volatility band width contracts.

```
Band Width = (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band
```

```Golang
bandWidth, bandWidthEma90 := indicator.BollingerBandWidth(middleBand, upperBand, lowerBand)
```

#### Awesome Oscillator

The [AwesomeOscillator](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#AwesomeOscillator) function calculates the awesome oscillator based on low and high daily prices for a given stock. It is an indicator used to measure market momentum. 

```
Median Price = ((Low + High) / 2)
AO = 5-Period SMA - 34-Period SMA.
```

```Golang
result := indicator.AwesomeOscillator(low, high)
```

#### Williams R

The [WilliamsR](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#WilliamsR) function calculates the Williams R based on low, high, and close prices. It is a type of momentum indicator that moves between 0 and -100 and measures overbought and oversold levels.

```
WR = (Highest High - Close) / (Highest High - Lowest Low)
```

```Golang
result := indicator.WilliamsR(low, high, close)
```

#### Typical Price

The [TypicalPrice](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#TypicalPrice) function calculates another approximation of average price for each period and can be used as a filter for moving average systems.

```
Typical Price = (High + Low + Close) / 3
```

```Golang
ta, sma20 := indicator.TypicalPrice(high, low, close)
```

#### Relative Strength Index (RSI)

The [Rsi](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cinar/indicator#Rsi) function calculates a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought and oversold conditions.

```
RS = Average Gain / Average Loss
RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))
```

```Golang
rs, rsi := indicator.Rsi(close)
```
